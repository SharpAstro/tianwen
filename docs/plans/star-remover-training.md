# Star-remover training (P4): the inject-and-remove bootstrap

**Status: R0 BUILT (2026-10-03), the first of the model plans in priority (the owner, 2026-10-02: #902 is
`priority:high`, above the gradient plan's de-vignetting model). The classical plate builder and its report
run on the ten held-out masters with holes below their null on every one ([R0 results](#r0-results-2026-10-03));
R1, the injector, is next.** Design captured in [ai-denoise-deconv.md](ai-denoise-deconv.md) section 2.5, restated here at run
level 2026-09-02 and reviewed against the code and the store on 2026-10-02 (section 9). It was written as
the LAST of the four imaging models because it waited on three things, and all three are in place: the
deconvolver programme's PSF distribution (P2.0 done 2026-09-06; the re-baked store measures it per channel),
the classical flattener (shipped 2026-09-02), and the owner's call on its order, raised when the SAS tier
went. The starless plate is the pipeline's workhorse intermediate (`RemoveStarsStep`, `--split-plates`, the
star/starless dual stretch, the comet layer), so a weak in-house remover would degrade every downstream
step. Until its gates pass, `IStarRemover` is RC-Astro (`sxt`) when licensed, else NOTHING: the SAS
`darkstar_*_AI4` fallback went with that tier on 2026-09-26, so without StarXTerminator the canonical
program runs whole-frame, `--split-plates` writes no plates and `--remove-stars` refuses, and with it the
comet layer.

**The goal (the owner, 2026-10-02): stellar extraction into two plates, a stars-only plate and a non-stellar
plate, with no star holes.** The two are the additive split the pipeline already uses (`RemoveStarsStep`,
stars = input minus starless), so they add back to the input exactly; what decides quality is the starless
plate, and its one forbidden artefact is a hole: a star's core left darker than the sky around it, by
over-subtraction or by a fill that misses its surroundings. Every stage measures it (R0's "Holes", the fill
probe, the net's spot checks).

Companions: [deconvolver-training.md](deconvolver-training.md) (the PSF family the injector uses),
[gradient-remover-training.md](gradient-remover-training.md) (the flatten step),
[model-training-roadmap.md](model-training-roadmap.md).

## 0. Why synthetic truth is the only honest truth here

Ground truth for EXISTING stars would need hand-editing (the reference remover's author is on record
that hand-editing was the only way). Ground truth for INJECTED stars is exact by construction: input =
plate + injected stars, target = plate. The plate does not need to be perfectly starless; residual
removal artefacts become background the net must preserve, never content it must invent. What that
requires is that the injected stars' positions be UNCORRELATED with the residual sites, or the net
learns "removing a star reveals an artefact" (Croman's "the network will faithfully learn all of your
mistakes").

Two archive properties make this narrower than a general remover's problem: almost every optic in it is
refractive (Samyang 135, ZS61, FMA180, SH61, SV545, RedCat 51), so almost no spider vanes or diffraction
spikes, and the PSF family is measured per (train, filter, channel) already. **Almost, not every** (found in
the 2026-10-02 review): the QHY294C's SWQ8 at 600 mm is a Newtonian, and every one of the eight brightest
stars in its 2026-02-20 Centaurus A master carries a four-point spike. Three masters in the store are on it
(Centaurus A, omega Centauri, the Running Chicken, all 2026-02-20). Spikes are fixed to the optic: their
orientation follows the sensor's rotation against the vanes and their length grows with the star's flux.
A user's Newtonian is common, so what v1 does with spikes is section 8's first question.

## 1. What exists, with pointers

| Piece | State | Where |
|---|---|---|
| The role and contract | shipped | `IStarRemover : IImageEnhancer`; `RemoveStarsStep`'s additive split `stars = input - starless`; `SharpenPipeline` retention via `SharpenIntermediates.StarsAndStarlessLineage` |
| Today's implementation | shipped | `RcAstroStarRemover` (the `sxt` CLI, licensed) behind the deferred `sxt` dispatcher (`DeferredEnhancer`, "RC-Astro only until TianWen's own"), and nothing else: `OnnxStarRemover` and the SAS `darkstar_*_AI4` weights went with that tier on 2026-09-26. The split has two modes, `RecombineMode.Additive` (the default, `stars = input - starless`) and `Screen` (`Unscreen`) |
| Star detection + measurement | shipped | `FindStarsAsync`, `ImagedStar` (HFD, FWHM via `HalfMaxDiameter`, eccentricity), `PsfProfileFit`, and the deblender: "the star mask splits into a footprint and a claim, so a close companion is measured", "two tight stars are two stars, by fitting the aperture instead of sizing it", then `BackgroundMap` / `SourceSegmentation` (the Background2D and detect_sources shapes) and the crowded-field rule (a large segment with many maxima is a field, not a source) |
| PSF distribution | measured, current | The re-baked store's `stats/psf-sessions.jsonl` (`D:/Astro-Dataset/2026-09-29-full`, recipe 3): `MasterProfiles` per channel (Moffat FWHM and beta, the wing at 2 and 3 FWHM, the Moffat and Gaussian fits' log RMS; three profiles on 338 records, one on the 42 mono ones), `BinsByChannel` (ellipticity by radius), the train on every record. Measured ON the master, so the warp and demosaic (or drizzle) widening is already in it, which is what an injector into a master needs. Saturation fraction 0.1 to 0.2 percent of detections |
| Degradation exporter | shipped, two of three modes | `DatasetDegradationExporter` (`tianwen dataset degrade`): `DegradationMode.Noise` (denoiser) and `Blur` (deconvolver), the noise anchored per channel on each master's recorded calibration and shaped by its integration (`NoiseShape.Warped`, E16b). Star injection is the third mode, R1 |
| Classical starless plate | built (R0) | `ClassicalStarRemover` (`TianWen.Lib.Imaging.StarRemoval`) with its finder (`PointSourceFinder`), fill (`HoleFill` over `PushPullFill`) and fill probe (`StarlessFillProbe`); `tianwen dataset starless-plates` writes the starless and stars-only plates and the report. Not yet an `IStarRemover` (the owner's call, section 6) |
| Bright-tail morphology | measured elsewhere | the "bright end scrambled by saturation" note on the Vela field; flat-topped cores give unstable centroids |

## 2. Hypotheses

**H1. A classical PSF-subtract-and-inpaint plate is good enough as a bootstrap target.** Its
imperfections are tolerable if they are CONSISTENT (the net learns to leave them) and if injected
stars land independently of them.
*Test:* build the plate for ten held-out masters; measure the residual at subtracted-star sites (in
background MAD) and the fraction of the frame the inpaint touched.
*Prediction:* residuals under 2 MAD at faint sites, visible rings at the bright saturated tail (which
is why the bright tail is the known hard case and RC stays preferred there), inpaint area under 5
percent of the frame. The ten masters span what the store holds: AHD and drizzled, OSC and mono,
broadband and line filters, a crowded field (omega Centauri), nebula-rich fields, and the SWQ8's
Centaurus A for its spikes, which no PSF fit takes and the report states rather than hides.
*Kill:* residuals dominate the plate. Then a plain masked-inpaint (no PSF fit) is the plate, and the
first-generation net's job shrinks to faint and medium stars only.

**H2. Injecting from the measured PSF distribution, per channel and per train, is what makes the
truth transferable.** Stars drawn from a single Gaussian would teach a Gaussian remover; the archive
carries Moffat wings 98x a Gaussian's at 2 FWHM.
*Arms:* Gaussian injection against Moffat injection from the (train, filter, channel) distribution
with elongation from the radius bins and a saturation/bloom model for the bright tail.
*Prediction:* on REAL existing stars (spot-checked at 1:1 on held-out masters, the only measurement
that is not synthetic), the Moffat arm leaves smaller halos.
*Kill:* no visible difference. Then a simpler injector ships.

**H3. Position independence is load-bearing and measurable.** Inject at uniformly random positions
(with a minimum distance from any subtracted site) and compare against injection AT the subtracted
sites.
*Prediction:* the at-site arm scores better on injected-star completeness and worse on real-star
spot checks (it has learned the artefact). This is the control that proves the bootstrap is not
learning its own mistakes; run it once, record it, and never inject at sites again.

**H4. Self-refinement converges rather than drifting.** Run the trained net on real masters, use its
output as better plates, re-inject, retrain. Each generation distils only our own model.
*Test:* three generations; measure injected-star completeness, background preservation under injected
stars, and the real-star spot checks per generation.
*Prediction:* completeness rises and then plateaus by generation 2; background preservation does not
degrade.
*Kill:* preservation degrades (the net starts inventing background where it removed a star). Then the
loop stops at generation 1 and the plate quality is the limit.

**H5. The additive split holds photometrically.** `stars = input - starless` must conserve star flux:
the stars plate's aperture sums equal the input's minus the local background.
*Gate:* signed flux bias under 0.5 percent per SNR band above 20 (programme section 7), measured with
`PhotometricRepeatability.Compare` on the stars plate against the input.

**H6. The stretched domain is right for this role.** `OnnxStarRemover` runs through
`ChunkedNafnetRunner` (MTF to 0.25). A star remover benefits from the stretch (faint stars are
lifted into the range the net sees), and injecting stars in LINEAR then stretching keeps the physics
honest.
*Design, not an arm:* inject in linear on the linear plate, stretch input and target with the TARGET
frame's MTF parameters (the deconvolver plan's rule), export through the P0 path.

## 3. Data and the exporter

Third mode of the shared degradation exporter (denoiser E1, deconvolver E2): source the retained
linear masters; build the classical plate per master (H1); inject N stars per 256 px cell (N drawn
from the master's own detection density so the synthetic field is as crowded as the real one), each
with a Moffat core from the per-channel distribution, elongation and PA from the radius bin the cell
sits in, a flux drawn from the master's own detected-flux distribution extended into the saturated
tail with a clipped flat top plus a bloom model; place at uniform random positions at least 3 FWHM
from any subtracted site; add the injected stars' own shot noise; `ToUnitRange`, `ApplyInputStretch` with
the target's parameters; cut cells. Record every injected star (position, flux, FWHM, beta, saturated
flag) in the manifest row, because eval is against exactly that list.

Four rules the denoiser and gradient programmes paid for since this was written (2026-10-02 review):

- **An injected star's noise must have its master's SHAPE**, through the exporter's existing noise path
  (the per-channel anchor on the master's recorded calibration, `NoiseShape.Warped` for its integration).
  A master's noise is correlated (band 1 over band 0 of a half pair 0.45 on a demosaiced master, 0.31 to
  0.33 on a drizzled one, against white noise's 0.22; `tianwen dataset degrade --measure-shape`), so a star
  injected with white noise is recognisable by its texture alone, and a net that learns "a star with white noise is the one to
  remove" leaves every real star in place.
- **Draw the profile from `MasterProfiles`, never the subs', and integrate it over the pixel.** The master's
  profile already carries the warp kernel and the demosaic or drizzle; a sub-2 px profile sampled at pixel
  centres does not blur by its label.
- **Edges are masked, never cropped** (the gradient plan's "Edges"): no star lands on an absent pixel of the
  canvas ring, and a cell that straddles it carries the presence the stretch already respects (the NAFNet
  pre-stretch measures covered pixels only).
- **A saturated star is injected as a STACK saturates, measured off the masters' own saturated stars**, never as a
  hard clip of plate plus star. A stack of clipped, dithered, normalised subs gives a plateau with soft edges, often
  one channel clipping before the others, sometimes a bloom: its level per channel, its radius against the
  amplitude the wings extrapolate to (`ClassicalStarRemover` reads both for every saturated star it fits) and its
  edge profile are what the injector reproduces. A net taught on hard clips learns to fill holes it will never
  see, and leaves the real ones' rims behind.
- **The bright tail is sampled on purpose**: the denoiser cleaned a bright level only once bright cells were
  in its pool and in its eval (E16b), and the saturated stars this remover is weakest on are 0.1 to 0.2
  percent of detections, so a cell draw proportional to the field never shows the net enough of them.

Held-out split by session, as everywhere, and one whole TRAIN held out besides: the store's PSFs and star
populations are train-specific (96 of the 172 flat-fielded masters are the ASI533 at 130 mm, most likely one
Samyang 135), users bring optics the archive never saw, and only a held-out train says whether the remover
learned stars or this archive's stars.

## 4. Model and recipe

The same 0.81 M residual U-Net first, predicting the STARLESS plate (the residual formulation makes
an untrained net the identity, which for a remover means "removes nothing", the safe direction). L2
on the tile minus the 16 px rim; a DoG band loss on the 2-8 px bands where star cores live; a flux
penalty on the implied stars plate (H5). Stretched domain through `ChunkedNafnetRunner` at
inference, so the tile-256 / stride-16 / overlap-64 constraints hold by construction. NAFNet-class
capacity only if the U-Net plateaus on completeness while the plate quality is not the limit.

**Start from the recipe that shipped, not the one this was written against** (2026-10-02 review): the
denoiser's `convmapb_s2` (D6 in [denoiser-training.md](denoiser-training.md)) is the same U-Net family
trained to convergence with seeds interleaved, the bright cells in pool and eval, and a conditioning plane
the runner computes as the eval did (`N2nLinearRunner`, `OnnxIoNames.IsImagePlusPlane`). Its export,
parity fixture and runner path are the template R5 follows.

**One alternative structure, held for H4's kill:** the third-party architectures read in the SAS study
([model-training-roadmap.md](model-training-roadmap.md) section 8, item 7) separate a positive subtractive
star layer from a gated inpaint branch that takes the hole mask as an input. That is R0's own structure
(subtract, then fill) learned end to end, and the hole mask is something we have exactly (the injected
footprints in training, the detections at inference). It is an arm only if the plain U-Net starts inventing
background where it removed a star.

## 5. Metrics and gates

- **Injected-star removal completeness** by flux bin (residual at the injected position under 1 MAD),
  including the saturated tail reported separately.
- **Background preservation under injected stars:** target vs output inside the injected footprints,
  RMS in MAD units, gate at 1.
- **Stars-plate flux conservation** (H5).
- **Real-star spot checks at 1:1** on held-out masters: bright saturated stars, close pairs (the
  deblender's domain), stars on nebulosity, and spikes on the SWQ8 masters. Human adjudication with a
  labelled comparison image; RC outputs never in the frame as a reference. The gradient plan's golden-set
  page is the shape for it (a private review page, each master's panels side by side, the owner's verdict
  stored with the page and read back): the owner's verdicts become the set every later generation is
  re-checked against, which is what H4's "preservation does not degrade" needs to be measurable.
- **Nebulosity at 4-16 px** held at parity (the remover must not eat knots).
- **No RC output** anywhere in the loop.

## 6. Experiments, in order

| Step | What | Cost | Decides |
|---|---|---|---|
| R0 | Classical starless plate builder (PSF-fit subtract at detections + multi-scale inpaint); residual report on ten masters | 2 to 3 days | H1 |
| R1 | Injector (third exporter mode) with the manifest of injected stars; the at-site control arm data | 1 to 2 days | H3 data |
| R2 | Gaussian vs Moffat injection, three seeds each; random vs at-site control; posted 1:1 comparison | 4 x 3 x ~11 min | H2, H3 |
| R3 | Self-refinement, two further generations | 2 x 3 x ~11 min plus plate rebuilds | H4 |
| R4 | Photometric gate on the stars plate | hours | H5 |
| R5 | Export, contract JSON, `OnnxTianWenStarRemover : IStarRemover` through `ChunkedNafnetRunner`, registered in `AddTianWenAi()` and answering `IEnhancerAvailability.Serves`, so `CanonicalProgram` can take the split without RC. Opt-in first (`--ai-backend n2n`, `EnhanceBackend.N2n`); once the bright tail passes the spot checks, Auto still prefers RC and the deferred `sxt` dispatcher falls back to the in-house remover where RC is not licensed | 2 days | Ships opt-in |

### R0: the classical plate builder

Designed 2026-10-02, before any code. **One routine, `ClassicalStarRemover.Build`**
(`TianWen.Lib.Imaging.StarRemoval`), returns a `StarlessPlate`: the plate, a mask of what it touched
(subtracted, inpainted), the fitted stars and the statistics below. It makes the training plates, and if its
report earns it, it is also the product's AI-free `IStarRemover`, as `ClassicalBackgroundExtractor` is for
gradients; that is the owner's call once the report is in.

1. **The PSF per channel is measured on the image itself** (`PsfProfileFit` on its own stars): FWHM and
   Moffat beta per channel. The PSF store holds the same measurement; the builder never needs the store, so
   it runs on any image.
2. **Finding: a matched-filter peak finder of its own** (`PointSourceFinder`), because neither detector
   does this job. `FindStarsAsync` selects stars to MEASURE: it returns nothing over a background at or below
   zero, skips 15 px at every edge and refuses an HFD over 28, which is every big saturated star.
   `SourceSegmentation` segments SOURCES: 64 peaks to a segment and a crowded field re-thresholded higher
   lose the faint stars on a nebula. The finder works on the luminance, with a local sky from `BackgroundMap`
   at a block of about 8 FWHM (at least 16 px) so it follows nebulosity, a Gaussian matched filter at the
   PSF's width, and local maxima at 5 sigma of the filtered plane's own robust noise, merged within one
   FWHM. Edges included: a fit uses whatever pixels are present.
3. **Fitting, brightest first on a working copy.** A Moffat with the channel's beta, integrated over the
   pixel (supersampled in the core, since a 1.5 px star does not blur by its label). On the luminance the
   centre and a width scale are fitted by Levenberg-Marquardt with the amplitude, sky level and sky plane
   solved linearly inside it; each channel then takes its own amplitude and sky linearly at its own width.
   Below 20 sigma a candidate keeps its found centre and the field's width and is fitted linearly only.
   **The fit is the star test**: a candidate that wants a width over 1.6 times the field's, or whose model
   explains under half its peak, is a knot, not a star, and is left in the plate. A flat core (the top
   pixels within 2 percent of the peak) is a saturated star and is fitted on its wings. One refinement pass
   re-fits every star with its neighbours subtracted, then the finder runs again on the residual for stars
   a brighter one hid.
4. **What is inpainted**: per star, the residual pixels beyond 3 sigma where its model exceeds 1 sigma,
   grown by a pixel; for a saturated star, the core where its model exceeds the plateau, grown by two.
5. **The fill**: a push-pull pyramid per channel (normalised averaging down, interpolation back up) over
   the mask, absent pixels weightless and never filled, then noise at the local rms (`BackgroundMap`) with
   the plate's measured lag-1 correlation (a three-tap kernel solved for it), so a filled hole has the
   plate's grain.

**The report** (`tianwen dataset starless-plates`, a JSONL store and a markdown table, the shape of
`gradient-report`), per master: stars found, subtracted, left as knots, inpainted; and four measures.

- **Residual at a subtracted site**: the RMS of plate minus local sky over the pixels within one FWHM of a
  subtracted, not inpainted star, in local sigma (pure noise reads 1), median per SNR band (5-10, 10-20,
  20-50, 50-100, 100 and up). Its **signed bias**, the mean over the same pixels in sigma over root n.
- **Inpaint fraction**: inpainted over present pixels.
- **Holes** (the goal's one forbidden artefact, added 2026-10-02): a subtracted star whose core in the plate, filled
  or not and over a saturated star's whole plateau, sits more than 3 sigma over root n below its own fitted sky.
  Noise alone puts about 0.1 percent of cores there (the synthetic field: 3 of 826). The verb writes the stars-only
  plate beside the starless one (input minus plate), so the pair is the deliverable, not only the plate.
- **Leftover point sources**: the finder at 4 sigma on the finished plate, as a fraction of the first
  pass's detections, per band. **This is the measure that decides whether a plate can be a target at all.**
  A star the plate keeps is a lesson in keeping stars: an injected star and a leftover one look the same to
  the net, so wherever leftovers rival the injected stars in number the net learns to leave stars. R1 sets
  its injection density per band from this.
- **Residual by field radius** (inner third against the corners): the price of an isotropic PSF where the
  optics elongate stars, which decides whether elongation must be fitted.
- **Fill error on known pixels** (the owner, 2026-10-02: what goes into a saturated core is the real problem).
  Holes of the sizes the master's saturated cores were given are cut at random star-free places in the same
  master, nebulae included, filled, and compared with the pixels that were there: the error in local sigma by
  hole size and by the structure under it. Exact truth on real data, and the measure a better fill (patch-based,
  or one that carries a filament's edges across) has to win on before it replaces the push-pull. On the
  synthetic field's smooth sky the push-pull already reads 1.4 to 1.6 sigma in the core, which is two
  independent noise fields' 1.41: on a smooth sky the fill itself adds almost nothing, and what is not known is
  how it does on structure.

**Where the hole question lands.** For the plate, a real saturated core is background in both the net's
input and its target, so the net learns to keep it, never to make it; what the NET learns to put in a hole
comes from the injected saturated stars, whose cores land on the plate's own pixels, so the truth under them is
exact (section 3 says how they must saturate). The classical fill matters in two places only: where the
builder becomes the product's AI-free remover, where the fill is what a user sees, and where a plate's filled
cores are so many that they shape what the net calls background.

The leftover measure uses the tool that did the finding, so it cannot see what the finder cannot; the
synthetic tests are its external truth. They build a plate (a smooth nebula, noise of a master's shape),
inject Moffats of known parameters (saturated ones, close pairs, a Gaussian knot three times the PSF's
width, stars on the absent ring's edge) and assert completeness, the residual bound, the knot kept, the ring
untouched, and the same output twice.

**The ten masters**, all from the store's held-out test split (`D:/Astro-Dataset/2026-09-29-full`): the
QHY294C on the SWQ8 (Centaurus A, drizzled, spikes); the ASI1600MM on the FMA180 (eta Carinae, luminance,
mono); the ASI294MM at 250 mm (Leo Triplet, luminance, mono); the SV605CC on the SH61 (the Horsehead through
the L-Quad, demosaiced; the SMC through the L-Ultimate, drizzled and crowded); the ASI533 at 130 mm (Orion
through the UV/IR cut and Antares through the LPS-D3, both drizzled with very bright stars; the Rim Nebula
in SII, demosaiced); the ASI585 at 24 mm (a Milky Way field at 24 arcsec a pixel, demosaiced, undersampled);
the Uranus-C on the FMA135 (M8 and M20, drizzled, no flat).

**Predicted before the run**, over those ten, beside H1's own:

- Residual at faint sites (SNR 5-20): median under 2 sigma on every master (H1). Above SNR 100: over 3 sigma
  wherever a star was subtracted but not inpainted.
- Signed bias: within 0.5 sigma over root n in every band below 100.
- Inpaint fraction: under 5 percent on nine of ten; the ASI585 at 24 mm (Milky Way, 24 arcsec a pixel,
  undersampled) is the one that may not be.
- Leftovers: under 5 percent at SNR 10 and above on every master but the crowded fields (the SMC, the
  24 mm Milky Way).
- Field radius: the corners' faint residual at least 30 percent above the centre's on the camera lenses
  (the ASI533's 135 mm, the ASI585's 24 mm), within 10 percent on the refractors (FMA180, SH61, FMA135).
- The SWQ8's spikes are left whole outside the inpainted cores; the report states it and does not count
  them as leftovers.

#### R0 results, 2026-10-03

`tianwen dataset starless-plates` over the ten masters, every plate pair also inspected by eye at its brightest
star, at its worst negative patch of the stars plate, at its worst dip of the starless one and at a fixed field
spot. Holes are cores more than 3 sigma over root n below the plate's own annulus sky, as a percentage of each
band, beside the same test at random star-free places of the plate (the null, which correlated noise and crowding
raise); residual is in local sigma (noise reads 1).

- **Holes: below the null on every master and every band**, which is the goal's one forbidden artefact. The
  stars-only plate (input minus starless) holds no negative patch summing past 220 sigma on any master but
  Antares, whose 517 is M4's unresolved core.
- **Residual at faint sites under 2 sigma: held** (eta Carinae's 10-20 band is the edge, at 2.00). **Above SNR
  100 it was predicted over 3 sigma and is 1.5 to 2.4**: the bright stars fit better than expected.
- **Bias within 0.5 sigma over root n below SNR 100: held on seven, missed on three**, all positive (light left,
  never taken): the Rim Nebula 0.88, M8 + M20 1.05, the 24 mm Carina field 1.53, the three crowded or nebulous
  fields.
- **Inpaint under 5 percent on nine of ten: wrong, three of ten.** The fill is the price of the hole rule: a core
  whose misfit is not noise is filled rather than left, and crowded fields have many. eta Carinae's 37.7 percent
  is a third of a confusion-limited Milky Way field; R1 has to weigh what a third of a target made by the fill
  teaches before that master enters the plates.
- **Leftovers under 5 percent at SNR 10 and up: held** everywhere but the Leo Triplet's 20+ band (0.10, the
  galaxies' cores and HII regions the fit calls knots, as it should).
- **Field radius: half right.** The refractors' corners sit within 10 percent of their centres (FMA180 7, SH61 6
  to 8, FMA135 within noise). The camera lenses were predicted 30 percent and more and read 12 to 25 (the 135 mm)
  and 1 (the 24 mm, whose stars are wide everywhere).
- **Spikes: left whole**, as decided; a giant's subtraction never digs between them (below).

#### What the ten masters taught the builder

Each was found on one master by eye and measured before it was fixed; none is specific to that master.

- **A saturated star needs a halo test, and the test reads the ring past its fit window**, never the background
  map at the star, which a bright star raises under itself. A wing fit whose sky is far from that ring holds light
  the field's Moffat cannot (the Horsehead's 4,933-sigma star: a sky 1,100 below, 2e6 for a 65,000 plateau, a blob
  and four over-subtracted lobes); it takes its own symmetric profile instead.
- **Saturation is the full scale, not only a flat top**: a clipped star stacked over sub-pixel shifts has a round
  top (9 Sgr, 0.98 of 0.99, fitted unsaturated at 1.61 times the field's width and left as a knot).
- **A giant's profile is the star's, not its surroundings'.** It is monotone, it ends where it flattens and is
  measured against that level, never a sky 100 px out; it falls no slower than the inverse square of its radius
  (the aureole's far wing); and it never takes a pixel more than 2 sigma below its level. Without the first three,
  nebula round eta Carinae (at 600 and at 24 mm) and 9 Sgr went into the stars plate and left dark discs; without
  the last, the Antares-field giant's 18 spikes had notches 4 to 20 sigma deep between them. Smoothing a halo
  before the minimum is wrong: a mean over a convex halo sits above it and dug a 0.7 sigma disc.
- **A giant's core is filled to its plateau's farthest pixel**, and its residual is flagged only where it dominates,
  against the plate around it (flagged to its full reach against the far sky, M42's nebula was filled as a disc
  110 px across).
- **A wide source is tried as a blend before it is called a knot**: two field-width stars along its long axis (the
  brightest Centaurus A "knots", 672 and 402 sigma, are doubles 3 px apart).
- **In a crowded field the filtered plane's spread is the stars, not the noise.** The finder's noise is capped by
  what the plane's lag-1 and lag-2 differences predict for a correlated noise (within 8 percent of the measured on
  every sparse field; eta Carinae's 107 to 149 against a prediction of 47), and the find on the residual repeats
  until a pass adds under a tenth of the one before: eta Carinae went from 73,605 sources to 160,162.
- **A fill may not rise above the data**: a star only adds light, so a fill more than 3 local sigma above the
  pixel it replaces takes the data's value. The local sigma there, and the fill's grain, come from the local
  differences too, because the rms map counts a nebula's structure and a crowd's faint stars as noise (the
  Trapezium's fill sat 0.26 above data whose noise is a hundredth of that; its negative patch went from 1,487 sigma
  to 34).
- **A core misfit alternates sign from pixel to pixel**, which a three-pixel mean averages away, so a pixel beyond
  5 sigma inside a footprint is flagged on its own (eta Carinae's +-3,000 ADU cores).
- **Edges and refits**: a NaN of the absent canvas no longer makes a plateau NaN (a 700-sigma star at Orion's
  edge was left whole), a centre fitted past the edge is no drift, and a refinement that fails puts back the fit
  it was meant to improve.

#### What R0 leaves

Tracked by #902 with the rest of P4.0; none of it is a hole.

- **Diffraction spikes** stay, section 8's open question.
- **Stars on a steep, bright nebula** that fit wider than 1.6 times the field (a curved sky under a planar one) are
  left as knots: Orion's 50-sigma star beside the Trapezium, Herschel 36 in the Hourglass.
- **Clipped nebula round a saturated star** (eta Carinae's Keyhole, the Trapezium) is filled from its boundary,
  which is darker than the clip it replaces; what was there is not in the data.
- **An elongated saturated star** (the Horsehead's 4,933-sigma one, its plateau 3 by 5 px) keeps a brighter fill
  where its core was: its residual past a symmetric profile is flagged and filled, and the fill takes the bright
  ends of its elongation as its boundary. An elliptical profile would follow it.
- **M4's core** keeps its unresolved glow and the stars on its bar, the one negative patch over 220 sigma.
- **eta Carinae's inpaint fraction** (above), and the faint stars of its Milky Way field still under the confusion
  the finder's deeper noise reaches.

### R1: the injector

Designed 2026-10-03, before any code, from R0's plates and the exporter as it stands
(`DatasetDegradationExporter`, `TianWen.AI.Imaging`: P0's 256 px cells, the clean tile in slot 0 and `deg###`
draws beside it, a `degradations.jsonl` row per draw, noise through `LinearDegradation`).

**A third mode, `DegradationMode.Stars`, of the same exporter**, so it inherits the cells, the bright-cell list,
the per-channel noise anchor (`master-calibration`), the noise field's shape, the resume and the P0-shaped
manifest. What differs:

1. **The clean tile is the STARLESS PLATE**, read from a `starless-plates` store (`--plates <dir>`, the plate of
   `session-masters/<id>.fits` at `plates/<id>_plate.fits`, its catalogue beside it). The plates of the whole
   pool are built once into the bake's own `starless/` folder; a session with no plate is skipped and counted.
2. **Each draw is the plate plus injected stars plus their own noise, and nothing else**: no extra noise level,
   no blur. Both are stretched with the TARGET's parameters (the plate's, measured once per session, H6) over the
   MASTER's unit divisor, so an injected saturated star cannot leave [0, 1].
3. **How many**: a cell gets as many stars as R0 subtracted in it, so the synthetic field is exactly as crowded
   as the real one there (and a crowded master's cells are crowded), plus, in a quarter of draws, one saturated
   star (the bright tail on purpose: 0.1 to 0.2 percent of detections would show the net almost none). Stars are
   placed over the cell and an 8 px margin, so a tile's edge cuts stars as a real tile's does.
4. **Where** (`--placement`): `random` (default) puts each at a uniformly random present pixel at least 3 FWHM
   from every site R0 subtracted, drawn again up to 200 times and otherwise dropped and counted; `at-site` puts
   them on R0's subtracted sites, jittered under half a pixel: H3's control, run once.
5. **How bright**: a real star of the same master is drawn at random from R0's unsaturated subtracted stars and
   its per-channel amplitudes taken whole, so the flux distribution and the colours are the field's own. A
   saturated star takes its clip levels and its wing amplitude over its clip from one of the master's own
   saturated stars (per channel: the core's level in the master; R0's wing amplitude over it); a master with none
   clips at 95 percent of each channel's brightest pixel, and says so.
6. **What shape** (`--profile`): `moffat` (default) at each channel's FWHM and beta from the master's own
   `MasterProfiles` (the PSF store), or `gaussian` at the same FWHM, H2's arm. Elongation and position angle are
   measured where the star lands: windowed second moments of the up to eight brightest isolated unsaturated stars
   of R0's stars plate within 384 px. Every profile is integrated over the pixel (Gauss-Legendre, as R0's).
7. **How a stack saturates**: as the masters showed (plateaus of 1 to 4 px at the median, edges 0.5 to 1 px from
   90 to 50 percent, a clip level that varies from star to star and, on 18 to 24 stars of some masters, one
   channel clipping first), a saturated star is rendered as a stack of eight virtual subs, each with its own
   amplitude (5 percent scatter), width (5 percent) and sub-pixel offset (0.25 px), each clipped where the plate
   plus the star passes its channel's level, and averaged. Its noise is scaled by the fraction of subs that did
   not clip, so a plateau is quiet as a real one is.
8. **Its noise**: the extra shot noise of the star at the master's depth, sqrt(sigma(plate + star)^2 -
   sigma(plate)^2) through each channel's anchor, on a field of the master's shape (the session's warped noise
   field); the plate already carries the sky's. The sigma plane beside each draw is the noise-free plate plus
   stars at that depth.
9. **The record**: every injected star goes into `injections.jsonl`, one row per draw (tile, cell, draw,
   placement, profile, the shortfall, and per star: x and y in the cell, the amplitude, FWHM and beta per channel,
   axis ratio, position angle, whether it is saturated and its clip levels), because eval is against exactly that
   list. `degradations.jsonl` gains the mode, the counts and the placement.

The load-bearing parts live in `TianWen.Lib.Imaging.StarRemoval` (the population drawn from a plate's catalogue,
the elliptical pixel-integrated profiles, the stacked saturation, the renderer) with tests there; the exporter only
cuts, calls and writes. R0's catalogue gains what the injector needs: each star's per-channel amplitudes and the
model it was subtracted with (Moffat, profile or pair), since only a Moffat-fitted saturated star has a wing
amplitude.

**Predicted before the run**, over the ten R0 masters' cells (the checks a test or a report makes):

- **Shape**: injected unsaturated stars of SNR 30 to 1000, fitted back on the draw minus the plate, give each
  channel's drawn FWHM within 5 percent and beta within 15 percent at the median (Gaussian arm: a Moffat fit's beta
  over 6).
- **Noise**: the injected noise's band-1 over band-0 ratio (as `--measure-shape` reads it) within 0.03 of the
  master's own half-pair ratio.
- **Saturation**: injected saturated stars' plateau sizes and 90-to-50 percent edges read like the master's real
  ones (the medians within a factor of 1.5), and no pixel passes its clip level.
- **Placement**: the random arm places at least 95 percent of what it is asked to on every master but eta Carinae
  and the 24 mm Carina field, whose crowding leaves too little room 3 FWHM from every subtracted site; no random
  star is nearer than 3 FWHM to one.
- **Determinism**: the same seed gives the same bytes, and the Noise and Blur modes' exports are unchanged.

#### R1 as built (2026-10-03)

`tianwen dataset degrade --mode stars --plates <store> [--placement random|at-site] [--profile moffat|gaussian]
[--saturated-fraction 0.25] [--psf-store <jsonl>]`, the noise anchor defaulting to `master-calibration`, the only
one it takes. The pieces are `StarProfile`, `StarInjection` and `InjectionPopulation` in
`TianWen.Lib.Imaging.StarRemoval`, and `StarlessCatalogue`, which now carries each star's model and per-channel
amplitudes (a catalogue from before reads back with neither, and the injector refuses it rather than guessing).
Two details differ from the design above. A cell's count is R0's count in the cell scaled to the cell plus its
margin, so the margin is as crowded as the cell. And an injected star's elongation comes from the NEAREST eight
measured stars within 384 px (unsaturated, isolated by 3 FWHM, significance 30 to 1000), not the brightest eight,
because elongation varies over a field (tilt, coma) and the nearest are the sample that shares it.

Three things the tests found while it was built, each fixed and pinned:

- **A windowed moment reads every star rounder than it is.** Through a circular window of two FWHM a star of axis
  ratio 0.6 read 0.677 (the angle exactly), because the window cuts the wings harder along the major axis. The
  population now reads each measurement back through the same window applied to the master's own model profile
  (a table over axis ratios, four sub-pixel centres): 0.596.
- **The render's reach was the box around a star, not its radius.** The corners reach 1.4 radii, past where the
  light is under the floor, and the sliver of noise added there flipped two f16 values 41 px from a saturated star
  whose reach is 29. The reach is now a circle; far from every injected star a draw is the clean tile to the bit.
- **The pixel-mean rule (three-point Gauss-Legendre, R0's) errs in the core pixel of a sharp star**: 1.3e-4 of
  the peak at 1.8 px FWHM and 4e-4 at 1.5 px, against 1e-5 at 3 px. `MoffatPsf`'s remark claimed 1e-5 at 1.5 px
  too and now says what it is. It is harmless to the injector (a net learns to remove whatever is rendered) and
  0.3 sigma on an 800-sigma 1.5 px star for R0.

## 7. Phasing

Tracked by #902.

| Phase | Deliverable | Exit |
|---|---|---|
| P4.0 | Classical plate builder with its residual report | R0 |
| P4.1 | Injector + control data | R1 |
| P4.2 | H2/H3 answered with posted comparisons | R2 |
| P4.3 | Self-refinement measured | R3, R4 |
| P4.4 | v1 opt-in | R5 |

## 8. Open questions

- **Diffraction spikes (the owner's decision, open).** Three masters (the SWQ8 Newtonian) carry them and
  a PSF fit takes none of them. Either v1 leaves them: the SWQ8 masters stay out of the plates and the
  training, one stays in the spot checks so what v1 does to a spike is seen, and the limit is documented;
  or the injector models them (orientation measured off those masters against the sensor, length grown
  with flux) and R0 subtracts them. The first is the recommendation: three masters cannot teach a spike
  model that generalises to other vanes, and a spike left whole is honest where a half-removed one is not.
- **The bright saturated tail** is the acknowledged hard case; whether v1 should refuse it (leave stars
  above a flux threshold in place, documented) or attempt it is a product decision for R2's spot
  checks.
- **Comet-registered stacking shipped** (`tianwen stack --comet`; `--remove-stars` builds the comet layer
  from per-frame star-removed plates), on RC alone. So this remover is what gives a user without
  StarXTerminator a comet layer at all, and per-frame use is why the additive split has to be photometric,
  not only cosmetic (H5): every sub's stars plate is recombined on a star-registered grid.
- **Met since 2026-09-02, kept for the record:** the dependency on P2 (P2.0 done 2026-09-06; R1 draws from
  the re-baked store's per-channel profiles) and on the flattener (shipped 2026-09-02).

## 9. Review, 2026-10-02

The plan read against the code and the store when the owner moved it up the order. What changed:

- **Order**: no longer last; the three things it waited on are in place (status line).
- **Wrong**: "every optic is refractive, no spikes" (the SWQ8 is a Newtonian, section 0); "no inpainter
  exists" (a low-pass one does, section 1); `OnnxStarRemover` and the SAS fallback (gone 2026-09-26). The
  deblender was cited by commit hash, which the docs never do; it is cited by subject now.
- **Added from the denoiser and gradient programmes**: the injected noise in its master's shape, the
  profile from the master's own measurement integrated over the pixel, edges masked, the bright tail
  sampled on purpose, a held-out train (section 3); the shipped denoiser as the recipe and R5's template,
  the two-branch structure held for H4's kill (section 4); the golden-set page for the spot checks
  (section 5); R5's wiring through `IEnhancerAvailability` and the `sxt` dispatcher (section 6).
- **Unchanged**: the inject-and-remove bootstrap, H1 to H6, the phasing. R0 is next, CPU only.
